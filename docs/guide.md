# AI-Assisted Video Content Creation Guide

## For Processing Hour-Long AI Coding Challenge Recordings

### Overview

This guide helps an AI assistant analyze transcripts from hour-long "AI coding challenge" videos where a creator uses GitHub Copilot in agent mode to build applications within a time limit. The AI should extract content for multiple video formats and identify key moments for editing.

## Segment Timing Rules (CRITICAL)

### Buffer Zones and Natural Endpoints

**Critical Timing Rule**: When identifying segment endpoints, always scan 30-60 seconds past the apparent feature completion to capture:

- Feature testing and validation
- Creator's immediate reactions and thoughts
- Natural transitions to next topics
- Any cleanup or reflection commentary

**End segments only at clear conversational breaks, not just when a feature appears to work.**

### Content Boundary Detection

### Natural Endpoint Indicators:

- Explicit transition phrases ("Now let's...", "Next up...", "Moving on to...")
- Clear topic shifts in conversation
- Pauses longer than 3-5 seconds
- Summary statements followed by new planning
- Creator saying "Alright" or "Okay" followed by new direction

### AVOID Cutting During:

- Feature testing and validation phases
- Immediate post-completion reactions
- Planning or setup for next features
- Reflective commentary on what just happened
- Mid-sentence or mid-thought moments
- Active debugging or problem-solving

### Segment Start Rules

### Lead-in Buffer Requirements:

- **Always scan 15-30 seconds BEFORE** apparent topic start
- Look for topic introduction and context-setting phrases
- Include anticipation, setup, and transition statements
- Capture the "why" and "what we're about to do" context

### Start Indicators to Capture:

- Transition phrases ("Now let's...", "Alright, now...", "The moment of truth...")
- Context-setting statements that frame what's coming
- Anticipation or expectation-setting commentary
- Previous topic wrap-up that leads into new topic
- Time pressure or milestone acknowledgments

### AVOID Starting During:

- Mid-explanation or mid-implementation
- After the action has already begun
- Missing the setup or anticipation context
- Cutting off important framing statements

### Segment Analysis Process:

1. **Scan backwards 15-30 seconds** from apparent topic start for setup/transition phrases
2. **Set start timestamp** to capture full context and anticipation
3. **Identify** main feature/topic development
4. **Find** apparent completion point
5. **Scan 30-60 seconds AFTER** completion for:
    - Testing/validation of the feature
    - Creator's immediate reactions/thoughts
    - Transition planning to next topic
6. **Set end timestamp** at natural conversation break
7. **Verify** no valuable content is orphaned between segments

### Buffer Zone Examples:

- Always extend segments 15-30 seconds past apparent completion
- Look for natural conversation breaks, not just feature completion
- Include post-feature reflection and planning for next steps
